#Code
There are multiple algoritmes made:

Algrandom.py is a random function which does not checks for validity.
generate_random_valid does on the other hand check for validity and only creates valid graphs. 
Furthermore there is a breathfirst, depthfirst, greedy, genetic and a hillclimber. 

Overlapping data is stored in helpers.py. 

## visualisation
histogram.py is used to make histograms.
