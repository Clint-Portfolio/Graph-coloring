# Radio Russia
The Russian government wants a proper distribution of transmission frequencies. There are exactly seven types of transmission masts available. For a good distribution it is necessary that two adjacent provinces do not have the same transmitter types.

## The Project:
### Assignment 1
a) Create a transmitter device for Ukraine. Every province must have a sender type, no two adjacent provinces may have the same sender type. Come up with a transmitter for the entire country, the fewer transmitter types you use, the better.

b) Do the same for China, the USA and ultimately for mother Russia.

c) It is cheaper to have fewer transmitter types, but also to have approximately the same number of all types of channels. For each country with every minimum number of transmitter types, try to determine what a balanced distribution would look like.

### Assignment 2
There are four possible cost schemes. For each country, see which cost scheme is the most advantageous
